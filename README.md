# Grouped Accessors and Auto-Accessors for ECMAScript

This introduces an investigation into new syntax for _grouped accessors_ to classes and object literals and _auto-accessors_ to classes. 
A _grouped accessor_ is a single declaration that contains either or both of the `get` and `set` methods for an accessor. 
An _auto-accessor_ is a simplified variant of a _grouped accessor_ that elides the bodies of the `get` and `set` methods and
introduces a private backing field used by both the getter and setter.

_**Under Consideration**: We may consider expanding _auto-accessors_ to work on object literals in the future, however the necessary
private name semantics are currently not defined for object literals._

## Grouped Accessors

```js
class C {
  accessor x {
    get() { ... } // equivalent to `get x() { ... }`
    set(value) { ... } // equivalent to `set x(value) { ... }`
  }

  accessor y {
    get() { ... } // equivalent to `get y() { ... }`
    #set(value) { ... } // equivalent to `set #y(value) { ... }`
  }

  accessor #z {
    get() { ... } // equivalent to `get #z() { ... }`
    set(value) { ... } // equivalent to `set #z(value) { ... }`
  }

  static accessor x {
    get() { ... } // equivalent to `static get x() { ... }`
    set(value) { ... } // equivalent to `static set x(value) { ... }`
  }
}

const obj = {
  accessor x {
    get() { ... }
    set(value) { ... }
  }
};
```

A _grouped accessor_ is essentially a way to define either one or both of the `get` and `set` methods of an accessor in a 
single logical group. This provides the following benefits:

- The `get` and `set` declarations are logically grouped together, which improves readability.
  - This can also result in an improved editor experience in editors with support for folding (i.e., `▶ accessor x { ... }`)
- A grouped `get` and `set` accessor pair with a _ComputedPropertyName_ only needs to have its name evaluated once.
- In a `class`, the setter for a public property can be marked as private using `#set`, this introduces both a public binding for the identifer,
  and a private binding for the identifier (but prefixed with `#`). For example:
  ```js
  class C {
    accessor y {
      get() { ... }
      #set(value) { ... }
    }
  }
  ```
  Introduces a `y` getter on the prototype and a `#y` setter on the instance.
- A decorator applied to the group could observe both the `get` and `set` methods simultaneously for entangled operations. For example:
  ```js
  function dec({ get, set }, context) {
    ...
    return { get, set, };
  }
  class C {
    @dec
    accessor x {
      get() { ... }
      set(value) { ... }
    }
  }
  ```
  - This allows you to reuse a decorator designed for an `accessor` field with a paired `get` and `set` declaration.
  - This also provides a capability that was present in the Stage 1 Decorators proposal that is currently missing in the Stage 3 Decorators proposal.

## Auto-Accessors

```js
class C {
  accessor a = 1;                   // same as `accessor a { get; set; } = 1;`
  accessor b { } = 1;               // same as `accessor b { get; set; } = 1;`
  accessor c { get; set; } = 1;     // same as `accessor c = 1;`
  accessor d { get; } = 1;          // getter but no setter
  accessor e { set; } = 1;          // setter but no getter (use case: decorators)
  accessor f { get; #set; };        // getter with private setter `#f`;
  accessor g { #set; } = 1;         // private setter but no getter (use case: decorators)
  accessor #h = 1;                  // same as `accessor #h { get; set; } = 1;`
  accessor #i { } = 1;              // same as `accessor #i { get; set; } = 1;`
  accessor #j { get; set; } = 1;    // same as `accessor #j = 1;`
  accessor #k { get; } = 1;         // getter but no setter
  accessor #l { set; } = 1;         // setter but no getter (use case: decorators)

  // also allowed:
  accessor "foo";                   // same as `accessor "foo" { get; set; }`
  accessor 1;                       // same as `accessor 1 { get; set; }`
  accessor [x];                     // same as `accessor [x] { get; set; }`
  static accessor a = 1;            // as well as all of the other non-static variants

  // not allowed:
  // accessor "bar" { get; #set; }  // error: no private setters for string properties
  // accessor 2 { get; #set; }      // error: no private setters for numeric properties
  // accessor [y] { get; #set; }    // error: no private setters for computed properties
  // accessor #m { get; #set; };    // error: accessor is already private
  // accessor #n { #set; };         // error: accessor is already private
}
```

An _auto-accessor_ is a simplified version of a _grouped accessor_ that allows you to elide the body of the `get`
and `set` methods, and optionally provide an initializer. An _auto-accessor_ introduces a unique *unnamed* private field on 
the class which is wrapped by a generated getter and an optional generated setter. Using `#set` instead of `set` indicates that a
private setter of the same name as the public member (but prefixed with `#`) exists on the object and provides privileged access to set the 
underlying value.

This provides the following benefits:
- Introduces accessors that can be overridden in subclasses without excess boilerplate.
- Provides a replacement for fields that allows you to observe reading and writing the value of the field with decorators.
- Allows you to perform initialization inline with the declaration, similar to fields.
- Allows you to decorate the individual `get` or `set` method stubs independently of the entire accessor. For example:
  ```js
  class C {
    accessor x { @dec get; set; }
  }
  ```
  - This allows you to reuse a decorator designed only for a `get` or a `set` method in the context of an `accessor` field definition.

## Proposed Syntax

Please see [the specification][Specification] for the proposed syntax.

## Proposed Semantics

Please see [the specification][Specification] for the full proposed semantics. The following represents some approximate semantics for this proposal. The gist of which is the following:

- Only `accessor` properties with _IdentifierName_ names can have a `#set` stub or `#set` method:
    ```js
    class C {
        accessor x { get; #set; } // ok
        accessor #y { get; #set; } // syntax error
        accessor "z" { get; #set; } // syntax error
        accessor 1 { get; #set; } // syntax error
        accessor [expr] { get; #set; } // syntax error
    }
    ```
- You cannot have both a `set` and a `#set` in the same group:
    ```js
    class C {
        accessor x { get; #set; } // ok
        accessor y { set; #set; } // syntax error
    }
    ```
- You cannot combine `get`, `set`, or `#set` stub definitions with `get`, `set`, or `#set` methods:
    ```js
    class C {
        accessor x { get; #set; } // ok
        accessor y { get() { return 1; } set(v) { } } // ok
        accessor z { get() { return 1; } set; } // error
    }
    ```
- You cannot combine `get`, `set`, or `#set` methods with an initializer:
    ```js
    class C {
        accessor w = 1; // ok
        accessor x { get; } = 1; // ok
        accessor y { get; set; } = 1; // ok
        accessor z { get() { return 1; } } = 1; // error
    }
    ```
- You cannot have an `accessor` property that has a `#set` stub or method that collides with another private name on the class:
    ```js
    class C {
        #w;
        accessor w; // ok

        #x;
        accessor x { get; set; }; // ok

        #y;
        accessor y { get; #set; }; // error (collides with #y)

        #z;
        accessor z { get() { } #set(v) { } }; // error (collides with #z)
    }
    ```
- Object literals cannot have auto-accessors:
    ```js
    const obj = {
      accessor x { get() { return 1; } }, // ok
      accessor y { get; }, // syntax error
    };
    ```

# Interaction with Decorators

This proposal is intended to dovetail with the [Decorators proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators) and shares syntax with
[auto-accessors](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-decorators#class-auto-accessors) in that proposal. This proposal expands upon the Decorators
proposal in the following ways:

- By adding an _AccessorGroup_ to an _auto-accessor_, you are able to decorate both the entire `accessor` declaration as well as the 
 individual `get` and `set` method stubs:
    ```js
    class C {
        @dec1 // called as `dec1({ get, set }, context)`
        accessor x {
            @dec2 // called as `dec2(fn, context)`
            get;

            @dec3 // called as `dec3(fn, context)`
            set;
        }
    }
    ```
- A decorator on a _grouped accessor_ is able to access both the `get` and `set` declarations, similar to early decorator implementations in 
  TypeScript and Babel:
    ```js
    class C {
        @dec1 // called as `dec1({ get, set }, context)`
        accessor x {
            get() { ... }
            set(v) { ... }
        }

        @dec2 get y() { ... } // called as `dec2(fn, context)`
    }
    ```
- Similar to _auto-accessors_, _grouped accessors_ can be decorated both at the `accessor` declaration level and at the individual
  getter and setter declarations:
    ```js
    class C {
        @dec1 // called as `dec1({ get, set }, context)`
        accessor x {
            @dec2 // called as `dec2(fn, context)`
            get() { ... }

            @dec3 // called as `dec3(fn, context)`
            set(v) { ... }
        }
    }
    ```

In addition, some aspects of _auto-accessors_ that may at first seem like edge cases become powerful capabilities with decorators:

```js
// Get-only accessors

// an accessor with only a getter and no initializer is has limited use on its own...
class Service {
  accessor users { get; }
}

// ...however a decorator could be used to perform dependency injection by replacing the getter:
class Service {
  @inject("userService")
  accessor users { get; }
}


// Set-only accessors

// A setter with no getter is has limited use on its own...
class WriteOnlyCounter {
  accessor inc { set; } 
}

// ...however, a decorator can replace the setter to make it more useful:
class WriteOnlyCounter {
  @observeChanges()
  accessor inc { set; }
}


// Private-set-only accessors

// The following could have been written as `accessor #value { set; }`...
class Widget {
  accessor value { #set; }

  exec() {
    this.#value = ...;
  }
}

// ...however, a decorator here could attach a public getter, which
// it would not be able to do if `value` was named `#value` instead.
class Widget {
  @decorator
  accessor value { #set; }

  exec() {
    this.#value = ...;
  }
}
```

This proposal also helps to provide consistency between decoration forms, which aids in reusability of decorators:

| Element                             | `kind: "get"` | `kind: "set"` | `kind: "accessor"` |
|:------------------------------------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:------------------:|
| `get x() {}`                        | ✔️ | ⛔ | ⛔ |
| `set x(v) {}`                       | ⛔ | ✔️ | ⛔ |
| `accessor x;`                       | ⛔ | ⛔ | ✔️ |
| `accessor x { get; set; }`          | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| `accessor x { get() {} set(v) {} }` | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |

  #x = 0;
  #y = 0;

  accessor x {
    get() { return this.#x; }
    set(v) {
      if (typeof v !== "number") throw new RangeError();
      this.#x = v;
    }
  }

  accessor y {
    get() { return this.#y; }
    set(v) {
      if (typeof v !== "number") throw new RangeError();
      this.#y = v;
    }
  }
}
```

## Auto-Accessors

```js
class Customer {
  accessor id { get; #set; } // public get, private set
  accessor name;
  constructor(id, name) {
    this.#id = id;
    this.name = name;
  }
}
const c = new Customer(1, "Jane");
c.id; // 1
c.id = 2; // TypeError
```
